<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To start using Adaptive, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Windows 7 and above
- League of Legends

### Installation & Usage

1. Download the latest [Release](https://github.com/developers192/Adaptive/releases/latest) (It might be flagged by your antivirus, whitelist it if that's the case)
2. Run `Adaptive.exe`. Run League of Legends.
3. Change your settings in-game. Press `Add Current` in the "Configs" tab to add the current config.
4. Switch to the "Modes" tab, you can select a config for each mode, or select "No changes".

<!-- Resource Usage -->
## Notes
Adaptive consumes virtually no CPU %.

Using "Start Adaptive with Windows" is not recommended as it will just sit there doing nothing but consuming your system resources. I recommend making a shortcut that starts both League and Adaptive.

You will NOT get banned for using Adaptive since it will just change your configs, not interact with the game in any way.
